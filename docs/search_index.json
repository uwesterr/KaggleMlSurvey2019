If a country or territory received less than 50 respondents, they were grouped and named “Other” for anonymity. The survey was live from October 8th to October 28th 2019. The median response time for those who participated in the survey was approximately 10 minutes. Easy histogram plot of all questions can be created in R as shown at https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/how-to-explore-the-2019-kaggle-survey-data 1.1 Purpose The purpose of the survery analysis is to create insight into which algorithms tools plattforms are used in the field of machine learning. Contrary to public opinon machine learning is not mainly focused on neural networks. "],

["survey-participants-education-level.html", "Chapter 3 Survey participants education level", " Chapter 3 Survey participants education level The following plot shows Survey participants education level. Very few participants have a non-academic background. By no means a academic background is a pre-requisit to use machine learning two skills are very helpful Coding experience Statistical knowledge Coding experience speeds up the process to implement the machine learning ideas and concepts. Most effort during a machien learning project will go into Data pre-processing Model tuning The actual implementation of the algorithm is mostly a matter of 10 - 20 lines of code. Below the neural network definition for a self driving RC model car of the donkey car framework. The neural network is defined using the Keras API which sits on top of Tensorflow, the program is written in Python img_in = Input(shape=input_shape, name=&#39;img_in&#39;) x = img_in x = Convolution2D(24, (5,5), strides=(2,2), activation=&#39;relu&#39;, name=&quot;conv2d_1&quot;)(x) x = Dropout(drop)(x) x = Convolution2D(32, (5,5), strides=(2,2), activation=&#39;relu&#39;, name=&quot;conv2d_2&quot;)(x) x = Dropout(drop)(x) if input_shape[0] &gt; 32 : x = Convolution2D(64, (5,5), strides=(2,2), activation=&#39;relu&#39;, name=&quot;conv2d_3&quot;)(x) else: x = Convolution2D(64, (3,3), strides=(1,1), activation=&#39;relu&#39;, name=&quot;conv2d_3&quot;)(x) if input_shape[0] &gt; 64 : x = Convolution2D(64, (3,3), strides=(2,2), activation=&#39;relu&#39;, name=&quot;conv2d_4&quot;)(x) elif input_shape[0] &gt; 32 : x = Convolution2D(64, (3,3), strides=(1,1), activation=&#39;relu&#39;, name=&quot;conv2d_4&quot;)(x) x = Dropout(drop)(x) x = Convolution2D(64, (3,3), strides=(1,1), activation=&#39;relu&#39;, name=&quot;conv2d_5&quot;)(x) x = Flatten(name=&#39;flattened&#39;)(x) x = Dense(100, activation=&#39;relu&#39;, name=&quot;fc_1&quot;)(x) x = Dropout(drop)(x) x = Dense(50, activation=&#39;relu&#39;, name=&quot;fc_2&quot;)(x) x = Dropout(drop)(x) angle_out = Dense(15, activation=&#39;softmax&#39;, name=&#39;angle_out&#39;)(x) throttle_out = Dense(20, activation=&#39;softmax&#39;, name=&#39;throttle_out&#39;)(x) model = Model(inputs=[img_in], outputs=[angle_out, throttle_out]) "],
["who-uses-which-algorithm.html", "Chapter 4 Who uses which algorithm", " Chapter 4 Who uses which algorithm There are plenty of machine learning algorithms in use, some have been around for quite some time already, others are quite new. Especially in the field of neural networks there is plenty of research ongoing as can be seen by a “neural network” search on the moderated but not peer reviewed electronic preprint plattform Arxiv. Splitting the graphs up for each category of education and plotting the percentage of usage for the given education level gives an insight into how the usage of algorithms differs over levels of education The graph above shows that regression and tree-based algorithms are very popular They are: Less computationally intensive than neural networks Available in the de facto standard machine learning library in Python, scikit-learn. Below historical data to some the algorithms are given, together with links to the wikipedia article of the algorithm.

Splitting the graphs up for each category of experience and plotting the percentage of usage for the given experience level gives an insight into how the usage of algorithms differs over levels of experience Regression and trees are popular at all level of experience Neural networks are more popular for less experienced 20% of very experienced use no algorithm "],

Splitting the graphs up for each category of experience and plotting the percentage of usage for the given experience level gives an insight into how the usage of new algorithms differs over levels of experience From the above graph it can be deducted that: Very experienced use new algorithms less often Newbies embrace them Evelutionary approaches are popular for medium experienced "],

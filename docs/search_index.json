If a country or territory received less than 50 respondents, they were grouped and named “Other” for anonymity. The survey was live from October 8th to October 28th 2019. The median response time for those who participated in the survey was approximately 10 minutes. Easy histogram plot of all questions can be created in R as shown at https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/how-to-explore-the-2019-kaggle-survey-data 1.1 Purpose The purpose of the survery analysis is to create insight into which algorithms tools plattforms are used in the field of machine learning. Contrary to public opinon machine learning is not mainly focused on neural networks. "],

Very few participants have a non-academic background. By no means a academic background is a pre-requisit to use machine learning two skills are very helpful Coding experience Statistical knowledge Coding experience speeds up the process to implement the machine learning ideas and concepts. Most effort during a machien learning project will go into Data pre-processing Model tuning The actual implementation of the algorithm is mostly a matter of 10 - 20 lines of code. Below the neural network definition for a self driving RC model car of the donkey car framework. The neural network is defined using the Keras API which sits on top of Tensorflow, the program is written in Python img_in = Input(shape=input_shape, name=&#39;img_in&#39;) x = img_in x = Convolution2D(24, (5,5), strides=(2,2), activation=&#39;relu&#39;, name=&quot;conv2d_1&quot;)(x) x = Dropout(drop)(x) x = Convolution2D(32, (5,5), strides=(2,2), activation=&#39;relu&#39;, name=&quot;conv2d_2&quot;)(x) x = Dropout(drop)(x) if input_shape[0] &gt; 32 : x = Convolution2D(64, (5,5), strides=(2,2), activation=&#39;relu&#39;, name=&quot;conv2d_3&quot;)(x) else: x = Convolution2D(64, (3,3), strides=(1,1), activation=&#39;relu&#39;, name=&quot;conv2d_3&quot;)(x) if input_shape[0] &gt; 64 : x = Convolution2D(64, (3,3), strides=(2,2), activation=&#39;relu&#39;, name=&quot;conv2d_4&quot;)(x) elif input_shape[0] &gt; 32 : x = Convolution2D(64, (3,3), strides=(1,1), activation=&#39;relu&#39;, name=&quot;conv2d_4&quot;)(x) x = Dropout(drop)(x) x = Convolution2D(64, (3,3), strides=(1,1), activation=&#39;relu&#39;, name=&quot;conv2d_5&quot;)(x) x = Flatten(name=&#39;flattened&#39;)(x) x = Dense(100, activation=&#39;relu&#39;, name=&quot;fc_1&quot;)(x) x = Dropout(drop)(x) x = Dense(50, activation=&#39;relu&#39;, name=&quot;fc_2&quot;)(x) x = Dropout(drop)(x) angle_out = Dense(15, activation=&#39;softmax&#39;, name=&#39;angle_out&#39;)(x) throttle_out = Dense(20, activation=&#39;softmax&#39;, name=&#39;throttle_out&#39;)(x) model = Model(inputs=[img_in], outputs=[angle_out, throttle_out]) 2.2 Who uses which algorithm There are plenty of machine learning algorithms in use, some have been around for quite some time already, others are quite new. Especially in the field of neural networks there is plenty of research ongoing as can be seen by a “neural network” search on the moderated but not peer reviewed electronic preprint plattform Arxiv. Splitting the graphs up for each category of education and plotting the percentage of usage for the given education level gives an insight into how the usage of algorithms differs over levels of education The graph above shows that regression and tree-based algorithms are very popular They are: Less computationally intensive than neural networks Available in the de facto standard machine learning library in Python, scikit-learn. Below historical data to some the algorithms are given, together with links to the wikipedia article of the algorithm. Linear regression Legendre, 1805 Gauss, 1809 Logistic regression Pierre Francois Verhulst, 1830s Random forest Ho, 1995 Gradient boosting trees L. Breiman, 1997 Convolutional neural networks Kunihiko Fukushima, 1980 Recurrent neural networks David Rumelhart, 1986 Dense neural networks Independently proposed by Alexander Bain, 1873 and William James, 1890 Generative adversarial networks Goodfellow, 2010-2014 2.3 Experience and algorithms Most of the survey participants have less than 3 years experience as can be seen in the graph below. Due to fact that the number in each category differs a lot a representation of percentages is beneficial for some analysis. The usage of algorithms for different duration of experience is given in the graph below. Splitting the graphs up for each category of experience and plotting the percentage of usage for the given experience level gives an insight into how the usage of algorithms differs over levels of experience Regression and trees are popular at all level of experience Neural networks are more popular for less experienced 20% of very experienced use no algorithm 2.4 Experience and new algorithms As newer algorithms there are Evolutionary Approaches Transformer Networks (BERT, gpt-2, etc) Generative Adversarial Networks where evolutionary approaches have been around for quite some time but the usage of them in machine learning is rather recent. Splitting the graphs up for each category of experience and plotting the percentage of usage for the given experience level gives an insight into how the usage of new algorithms differs over levels of experience From the above graph it can be deducted that: Very experienced use new algorithms less often Newbies embrace them Evelutionary approaches are popular for medium experienced 2.5 Role of participants The role of the participants is shown in the graph below The numbers for certain categories certainly have to be taken with a grain of salt since it is not clear how well the participants will differentiate e.g. “Data Scientist” and “Data Analyst”. However, it is clear that students are quite active on Kaggle. This might influence the later data since students tend to use freeware more than professionals. Also there are: - Many Software engineers - Very few Statistician 2.6 Company size The company size of the participants is shown in the graph below Small companies use ML Large companies use ML 2.7 Company incorporation of machine learning The degree of machine learning utilization in the companies of the participants is shown in the graph below All participants of companies with &gt; 10,000 employees declare that “We have well established ML methods (i.e., models in production for more than 2 years)” Splitting the graphs up for each category of company size and plotting the incorporation of machine learning shows this even more clearly Leaving out the “&gt; 10,000 employees” category for better comparision More companies explore machine learning than having it established Many companies don’t use machine learing 2.8 Favorite media sources on data science topics The favorite media sources on data science topics are shown in the graph below A few links to sources Kaggle forums.fast.ai medium blog 2.9 Favorite online course plattform Platforms on which survey participants have begun or completed data science courses are shown in the graph below All levels of academics are active on online course plattforms 2.10 Favorite data analyzing tool Participants primary tool to analyze data are shown in the graph below Most like to use free tools using the programming language “R” and “Python” 2.11 Experience in data analysis coding The duration of participants writing code to analyze data is shown in the graph below 2.12 Favorite integrated development environments (IDE’s) Favorite integrated development environments (IDE’s) are shown in the graph below 2.13 Favorite hosted notebook products Favorite hosted notebook products are shown in the graph below 2.14 Favorite programming languages Favorite programming languages are shown in the graph below 2.15 Recommended entry programming language Recommended programming language for aspiring data scientist to learn first are shown in the graph below 2.16 Favorite data visualization libraries or tools Favorite data visualization libraries or tools are shown in the graph below 2.17 Favorite specialized hardware Favorite specialized hardware are shown in the graph below 2.18 Favorite machine learning frameworks Favorite machine learning frameworks are shown in the graph below 2.19 Favorite cloud computing platforms Favorite cloud computing platforms are shown in the graph below 2.20 Favorite big data / analytics products Favorite big data / analytics products are shown in the graph below 2.21 Favorite automated machine learning tools (or partial AutoML tools) Favorite automated machine learning tools (or partial AutoML tools) are shown in the graph below "],

You can use anything that Pandocâ€™s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. ## [1] &quot;Here is the structure of the dataframe we want to start the analysis with:&quot; ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 19717 obs. of 9 variables: ## $ age : Factor w/ 12 levels &quot;18-21&quot;,&quot;22-24&quot;,..: 2 6 9 6 2 8 2 2 2 9 ... ## $ gender : Factor w/ 5 levels &quot;Female&quot;,&quot;Male&quot;,..: 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 ... ## $ country : Factor w/ 60 levels &quot;Algeria&quot;,&quot;Argentina&quot;,..: 16 22 17 3 22 16 22 59 59 33 ... ## $ job_title : Factor w/ 14 levels &quot;&quot;,&quot;Business Analyst&quot;,..: 12 12 1 8 8 5 5 5 14 8 ... ## $ salary : Factor w/ 27 levels &quot;&quot;,&quot;&gt; $500,000&quot;,..: 16 20 1 14 18 22 5 25 1 3 ... ## $ coding_years: Factor w/ 9 levels &quot;&quot;,&quot;&lt; 1 years&quot;,..: 3 9 1 3 2 5 6 6 6 7 ... ## $ ml_years : Factor w/ 10 levels &quot;&quot;,&quot;&lt; 1 years&quot;,..: 3 1 1 5 2 4 5 7 3 2 ... ## $ py : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;&quot;,&quot;Python&quot;,&quot;What programming languages do you use on a regular basis?

["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!
